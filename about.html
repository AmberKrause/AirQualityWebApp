    <h1>About the Air Quality Web App</h1>

		<div class="container">
			<h2>The Project:</h2>
			<p>The Air Quality Web App uses two APIs in order to plot air quality measurements on a geographic
				map. The map and its basic functionality is created using the Google Maps API. The air quality
				measurements are obtained using the Open AQ Platform and then the data is overlayed with the map
				using the Google Maps API. The data and map are updated as the user interacts with the map or UI
				controls.
			</p>
			<p>This project also uses the framework AngularJS. This provided us with organized control over the
				map and data table, two-way data binding for the map's search box, and access to the $http service.
